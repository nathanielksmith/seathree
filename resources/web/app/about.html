        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            SeaThree scrapes live the Twitter feeds of activists,
            journalists, citizens and officials from Spanish and
            English speakers in North and South America and translates
            it in real time. We have curated a select "list of lists" after
            discussing with many people about what accounts would be
            important to follow.
        </p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            We at SeaThree wondered why the Internet&emdash;with such
            a global architecture&emdash;has remained linguistically
            and geographically divided. What valuable voices are lost
            across state lines and local languages? Being based in
            California, we are aware of how our border with Mexico has
            become increasinly militarized. Journalists are tragically
            frequent targets of violence in Mexico and our American media
            continually demonizes the Mexican drug war. As walls are
            raised while trade laws are relaxed, it is imperative to
            hear the voices on the ground in order to build a more
            fair and aware relationship between Mexico and the United
            States. SeaThree is a tiny but important step in that direction.
        </p>

        <h2>Operating Costs</h2>
        <p>
            SeaThree uses Google's Translation API, which costs $20 for
            every 1,000,000 characters translated. We are hosted on
            Rackspace and spend around $11 a month on hosting. We
            accept donations via Paypal, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin and
            rely on them to keep the service going.
        </p>
